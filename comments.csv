I disagree a bit on the efficiency standpoint, to some degree. I agree that things have gotten more efficient, but when the market\'s goal is to sell more things then companies will find ways to sell us things we don\'t need. Apple right now could build an iPhone that lasts 10 years with a great battery, easily repairable, etc...but there\'s not much to SELL there. So instead we get a new iPhone every year that has a bigger screen, better camera, better apps, etc. Things that are small improvements, but more marketable and then through advertising, they tell the story of ""this is the best iPhone ever"" and people buy it up. \n\nNot totally sure how it\'s possible, but I would love to see a drastic curtailing of advertising.

But cars will still always be more practical at times, particularly if you have kids. For example if your kid is sick, or injured, it’s not practical to only rely on a bike - uber and public transportation are obviously not ideal options when dealing with a sick person who may be contagious, let alone feeling unwell. Also, dealing with elderly people, like my parents who have bad joints and can’t walk long distances easily, etc. It’s just… the more people you feel responsible for and the older you get, unless you live in an urban center with fairly short distances between necessary amenities, like grocery stores and hospitals, it’s simply not ideal to not own a car. \n\nIt would be ideal to pursue improving public transportation AND making cities especially more bike friendly, but cars are certainly a technology we should not be taking for granted.

And I say up to, so for many that are probably less. So the 30-mile commute would be too long. If you live in an area with good public transportation in the Netherlands, you would be able to cover distances of over 60 miles in a single commute in around an hour. The worse the public transportation gets (usually the more rural it gets, the worse the coverage), the less distance you can cover in an hour. What you could do is the bike to a station, go by public transport, and bike again from the destination station to the workplace if the locations make that possible. The average distance to a train station in the Netherlands is 5.1 km. and the distance to a major transfer station is 13.5 km. \n\n>But cars will still always be more practical at times, particularly if you have kids. For example if your kid is sick, or injured, it’s not practical to only rely on a bike - uber and public transportation are obviously not ideal options when dealing with a sick person who may be contagious, let alone feeling unwell.\n\nAnd there is a reason 73% of Dutch households still have a car. Sometimes it is just handy. They just have the freedom on how to go to certain places. Of course, the more rural it gets, the more households have cars and the less you can rely on cycling and public transportation. But depending on the rural area you could still rely on bicycles and public transportation (when adequate coverage) for certain things.\n\nAlso, if the kids are older, you could usually let them go to the GP (and let them make their own appointments) themselves if it is not too severe. And if they are younger, you could definitely carry them on your bicycle. It is not as impractical as you'd think, and some fresh air might do some good as well. It is certainly easily possible. The average distance to a GP post in the Netherlands is 1 km and in rural areas that is 1.2 km. In very urban areas that is 500 meters on average. The average distance to pharmacies is 1.2 km and to urgent care, it is 6.8 km. The average distance to hospitals is 7.1 km (4.8 km including outpatient clinics). So distances are not a problem.\n\n>Also, dealing with elderly people, like my parents who have bad joints and can’t walk long distances easily, etc. \n\nOf course, when the joints are bad it is difficult a move a lot. But for the elderly, it is very important that they keep moving. Getting around with a bicycle is great for that. The electric bike has been a favorite among the elderly, as they could cover long distances with a bike again with minimal input. They use it for leisure (cycling trips) and for everyday use, like grocers. For example, the average distance to grocery stores in the Netherlands is 800 meters. In rural areas it is 1.1 km., and in very urban areas it is 469 meters. So it is easily covered with bicycles.\n\n>unless you live in an urban center with fairly short distances between necessary amenities, like grocery stores and hospitals, it’s simply not ideal to not own a car.\n\nGood thing that 83% of the US population lives in urban areas.

But that is exactly where the Netherlands already is. It is probably the best bike infrastructure and use in the world. But it doesn't prevent the Netherlands from having a world-class car, public transportation, port, and airport infrastructure. You got the choice of what transportation method you'd want to use. If you are poorer, you could decide not to get a car, saving lots of money to spend on other things for example.

The whole concept of voting with your dollars is a lie you\'ve been sold by capitalism to make you believe you have some sort of impact over corporations when in reality they have a myriad of ways of getting you to buy their products.\n\nI, for example, recognize that cruise ships are an environmental disaster. I boycott them, yet they still run a massively profitable empire. I guess people just don\'t give a shit then, and it\'ll take way too long to shame them individually. I\'d rather just ban cruise ships in entirety, not try and appeal to a ""free market capitalism"" that is the very source of the problem in the first place.\n\nRecognizing that corporations are the bulk of the problem and that systemic change is necessary is also not incompatible with making changes to your own life.

I’ll read it when I get a chance and edit with a response.\n\nEDIT: I haven't read the paper yet but thought I should address your question in the meantime.\n\nIncreasing the amount of horticultural production *will* increase the amount of fertiliser, pesticides, diesel, water, and energy needed, as modern horticulture relies heavily on the use and availability of these inputs. If plant-based systems use less water, great; but what about the rest? What would be the impact of increasing our pesticide usage, as an example, by the amount required for horticultural production to offset animal production? We're already seeing a [huge decline in insect biodiversity, largely attributed to agricultural intensification and synthetic fertiliser and pesticide use](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320718313636?via%3Dihub), and even more production of the same crops is likely to increase that pest pressure, and therefore the reliance on pesticides, even higher. At the end of the day, the inputs have to come from somewhere, and by removing animals from the equation, you remove a contributing source to almost all of them, among many other beneficial things.\n\nAlso, seeing as how you brought up land use and I can discuss it without reading the paper, I'll address that too because I think it's an often poorly-communicated topic. Firstly, it's massively skewed by extensive livestock production, particularly in arid regions where cropping isn't possible or practical (e.g. much of Australia), and in places like Africa where there are a lot of farmers that can't afford intensive production systems (livestock or otherwise) and the land doesn't necessarily support them easily. (On that note, think about the effect and practicality of removing animal agriculture from these people). Secondly, the fact that livestock use more land isn't necessarily a bad thing - it can actually be a huge positive. Think: if you've got 1000 head of cattle on 100,000 acres, they aren't likely to have a huge impact on that land and ecology, right? So the down side is slim to none, depending on the environment, and the up-side is that we can have a minimally-affected environment (yay environmental services, biodiversity, etc.) and produce food and other useful resources, potentially from an area that we can't crop, at the same time. Now think about the ecological impact of a market garden that takes up 0.1% of that space, but pretty much nothing grows there except the crops; they're sprayed with insecticides regularly, so whatever insects migrate in from the surrounding environment don't live for long; there's bird deterrents and the occasional (or not so occasional) bird cull; and there's strong fencing that keeps out all other ground-bound animals. In this comparison, it's hard to argue that the extensive livestock production is worse. That's why, generally speaking, land use efficiency is a pretty useless metric to consider when discussing such heterogeneous (global) agricultural systems and environments, because context and details matter, and they get lost in the simplification. It's not just about the area.""}","{'subreddit name': 'sustainability', 'keyword': 'air', 'body': 'Yes alot of is fed to animals as a fucking soy cake about 70%. \n\nNo one here is advocating for factory farms and the practices. \n\nThere is a huge difference cattle raised in factory farms and Regenerative agriculture. \n\nOne has soy cakes and cages the other has clover pastures and minimal cattle.

The Finnish facility is not entirely consistent with Canada’s nuclear waste plan, because CANDU reactors use unenriched uranium, but that’s OK.\n\nAs expected, the documentary talks about the scope of nuclear waste in terms that lead innumerate people to think it’s a huge problem, without setting any context or comparing the amount of nuclear waste to that of other industries.  Here’s a link that shows Canada’s high level nuclear waste is increasing by less than 400 cubic metres per year, and totals less that 13,000 cubic metres for over 60 years of operation.\nThe total high level nuclear waste in Canada is expected to increase to less than 23,000 cubic metres by 2100.  By way of comparison, 400 cubic metres is less volume than the cement used for a single 2.5MW windmill.\n\nhttps://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/nrcan/files/energy/pdf/uranium-nuclear/17-0467%2520Canada%2520Radioactive%2520Waste%2520Report_access_e.pdf\n\nhttps://www.americanexperiment.org/74-percent-of-wind-turbine-mass-is-in-the-foundation/\n\nIn Canada, high level nuclear waste (generally spent fuel pellets) are stored for some time in pools, as shown in the documentary, for about 20 years.  After that time, the nuclear waste is transferred to dry, cement storage containers in a “shirt sleeve” facility.  This is not shown in the documentary, doubtless because it’s less photogenic and doesn’t reinforce their fearful message.\n\nThe documentary also stresses the risks of radiation from nuclear waste, and raises the spectre of a Chernobyl type accident recurring.  While tragic, more people are killed installing solar panels every year than died from radiation at Chernobyl and since the accident.  https://www.unscear.org/unscear/en/areas-of-work/chernobyl.html .  The fact is that the probability of another catastrophic failure (outside of Ukraine) is extremely small.  \n\nThe largest long term risk to human health from Canada’s high level waste is uranium chemical poisoning.   Conceptually, this is equivalent to the risk of lead poisoning from old dishes in existing landfills.  However, unlike those old dishes, a lot of very smart people will have worked a very long time (hundreds of years) to ensure that the lead does not leach out (ever) using a successful design pattern supplied by Mother Nature, as indicated in my previous response.\n\nHaving made a living in high tech development organizations, I understand that engineers will never say that something will work until they’ve demonstrated that something.  It’s tough to do that for a Canadian DGR with an intended life span of 500,000 years.  If the biggest risk to humanity is that a group of unlucky, industrious and technologically ignorant people manage to dig through 500 metres of granite and get poisoned by drinking water with dissolved uranium, in my judgement that’s close enough to a perfect solution.'}","{'subreddit name': 'sustainability', 'keyword': 'air', 'body': 'Do I detect a “overpopulation is the real problem” here?

The poor do not have a higher impact on the environment. The poorest 50% of the world population is only responsible for 7% of greenhouse gas emissions, the richest 1% are responsible for 15%, this means that 70 million people have double the impact of another 3.5 billion together.

This is a pretty difficult one, I think it is technically true. Statistically, more people in 'richer' countries care about the environment. There's one thing that JP is overlooking -or willfully omitting?- there though. Not all 'rich' people care more about the environment, and they probably are still a minority. See the recent climate marches, like the [one in Amsterdam](https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/qo72nb/more_than_40000_people_got_together_today_in/). Sure, 40k people sounds like a lot, but that amount is a statistical error when considering the population of the Netherlands. While more people may care about the environment, it is not nearly enough to take decisive and effective action, either by politicians or business.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what are my thoughts here? First, JP is a very inspiring speaker, he can be very convincing, but even though he may be speaking the truth, there can be more to facts than just what a speaker is presenting. We must not forget that while JP is a smart guy, he's educated on a completely different topic and may -willingly or not- misrepresent facts regarding sustainability.\n\nNow, the more complex topic is; there are many people living in poverty, and this is something that should be fixed for sure, but there is also a climate crisis ongoing. These are **both** topics that should be resolved, and, IMO, putting this as an either/or issue is distracting from the actual challenges.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuick further point: Please lets keep the topic on sustainability and not about other topics JP is involved in, this is not the right sub for that.""}","{'subreddit name': 'sustainability', 'keyword': 'air', 'body': 'Kinda related but I used to wash all my clothes after one use.

Dairy milk is not without health issues if abused (like anything), but some of these alternatives are awful nutritionally even plain, and worse when choc-full of processed sugar like you'll usually find them.  It depends on your nutritional needs but just pay attention if you drink a lot of milk because the more you drink, the more you'll need to pay attention.\n\n2: This is why reducing consumption first may work better - I've tried several times and it went WAY better for me than a straight switch.\n\nI was raised on milk like no other - literally I remember the first time I drank plain water around middle school very clearly because I had NEVER done that - literally not a single liquid besides milk, orange juice, and occasionally lemonade or huggies.  I played a LOT of sports so somehow wasn't a total tub of lard, but yeah - I drank 1-2 gallons of milk per day when I grew up.  My family literally had a huge second fridge with not a single thing in it but milk, and a whole shelf of our main fridge was milk too.\n\nWhen GOMAD was big I embarrassed myself because I thought my friends thought it was funny because who ONLY drinks 1 gallon of milk per day?!\n\nMy case is obviously extreme, but based on friends who've tried to switch different ways, reducing as far as you can before switching works much better - both so you can adjust to the changes in nutrition to see what works, and because several studies have shown dairy is literally addictive and there are arguably some drugs that are easier to go off of suddenly.\n\nAlso nutrition and addiction aside, it'll have a pretty big impact on your gut biome - especially if you eat cheese or ESPECIALLY greek yogurt and suddenly stop full-tilt.\n\nIf you can do it, go for it - nothing that bad will happen if you fail.  I mention all these reasons not because any (or even all together) are they THAT bad, but just for the full list of reasons you might be struggling.\n\nJust remember perfection can be the enemy of the good if you are a big dairy consumer - reduction is good too.  For me buying more sustainable/healthy versions (glass bottle, organic/no growth hormone, grass-fed, etc) which were more $$$ was the easiest way to curb my consumption - my budget didn't change so then my diet had to.""}","{'subreddit name': 'sustainability', 'keyword': 'air', 'body': ""This could be fairly misleading.

Sure, most of us recycle and buy stuff in thrift shops, some of us even chose to go vegan, but deep down we know that our rich lives, with all its luxuries and comforts, are pretty far from what this world needs. Sure, we don't have to be absolutely perfect, but reducing our waste levels with 10% so we can pretend to be environmentally friendly is just not going to cut it.\n\nPeople are simple creatures,...we are not renowned for our long term thinking skills. That is why we need to be controlled by systems that do. By people we choose to lead us, because they are wiser, because they know better. Unfortunately though, generally speaking, politicians and captains of industry are even more egocentric than we are. What kind of examples are they showing us?\n\nI am no the opposition, as you suggested. I am just trying to say that we should try to first admit we are hypocrites and then try to do something about it. In stead of rooting for others to solve our problems while we continue living the good life. Hurray, the leaders of the world came together and admitted we are in trouble, they even agreed on some potential measures, like they did 40 years ago, everything will be just fine now. Let's celebrate with a BBQ.\n\nAnyway, I personally start to lean towards a solution like 'climate taxes'. Let's help the scientists and engineers save us by providing them everything they need. Also, indeed, by trying to reduce our footprints so at least we can buy them a little bit more time. But do I believe our leaders are deserving of our hope and they will get us there? Hell no! It is either us or the scientists. I will put my money on the latter.""}","{'subreddit name': 'sustainability', 'keyword': 'air', 'body': ""I agree with you.\n\nYet it feels like world leaders plan to do jack shit about climate change, and this all feels like a farce and a waste of energy.

Many of these countries have taken climate change very seriously for a long time.  For example, Germany spent the early 2000s pouring a ton of funding into photovoltaic R&D.  They got the tech to the point that it could be commercialized, which then led to mass production of solar panels in China.  We all have the German government to thank for how cheap and efficient solar panels are today.  Scandinavian and Low Land countries led the push for wind turbines and got them to be cheap.  I am extremely optimistic that we will beat the current 2040 goals being set.  Why?  Because renewables are cheap.  It is now cheaper to install new wind turbines than it is to keep running an existing coal plant.  That's insane!  And the prices of solar and wind are still rapidly dropping!  Investors are also putting a ton of money into storage.  No matter what the government wants or who is lobbying them, fossil fuels just don't make economic sense anymore and will be rapidly disappearing from the energy mix over the next decade.  The next biggest thing is to get rid of ICE vehicles, and the tide seems to be turning on that over the next few years, especially as battery tech gets better and car batteries become a source of renewable grid resilience.  So yes, stay cynical about our insanely corrupt government here in the US (see [Steve Donzinger](https://www.amnestyusa.org/urgent-actions/urgent-action-environmental-lawyer-arbitrarily-detained-usa-ua-105-21/))...  But be optimistic about where our economy and public opinion is headed!  The governments that don't care wouldn't be flying to Glasgow if they didn't have to appease the public, and that is an important change in the past few years.  We are in the midst of painful and chaotic times... and these are the times that are the ripest for change!

But what I can tell you is that this is precisely the kind of system we need for the survival of our species on this planet.\n\nAnyhow.

There is no other way to push for better public transportation than by voting. \n\nAnd have you not heard of the green new deal? A political proposition that would single handedly do more for the environment than if literally everyone became vegan tomorrow? By not voting, you are effectively making the world a less sustainable place.\n\n>It\'s hilarious how you think that\'s the only thing we can do to change this, like we are hellbent on the will of the politicians.\n\nI never said it was the only thing. I said it was the most *important* thing.\n\n>Ever heard of activism?

And what activism do you do and what are you hoping to accomplish that isn\'t political in nature?\n\n>What\'s stopping you from cutting meat from your diet?\n\nIt\'s funny that this is your line of attack. Your decision to not vote is doing more damage than if I was to eat meat 3 times a day every day.\n\nAnd for the record I shop as sustainability as my budget allows. Not everyone is wealthy enough to make sustainable meal choices. And shaming people who eat meat is, imo, terrible politics that will drive people away from joining us in sustainability. And even if everyone became vegan overnight, we\'d still be a completely unsustainable society.\n\nEven if you care about the damage caused by factory farming (which I assume you do if you went vegan), your refuse to partake in politics by voting, ignoring that factory farmers receive substantial subsidies from the government, ultimately means that you are helping them. So let that sit on your conscience.\n\n>Its funny how you expect the big corporations to make a change\n\nI don\'t. You have to force them to with political legislation.

Money that I contributed went directly to help AOC win her seat.\n\n>yet your too selfish to even lift a finger when it comes to to things you personally can do\n\nYou can fuck off with this accusation. I do what I can on a personal level to help the environment.

Genuinely no offense meant, but you seem very ignorant on the footprint of animal products. It\'s immense and unacceptable, especially when talking about environmentalism.\n\n>Furthermore, there are plenty of examples where an overpopulation of a certain species can wreck havoc on the environment, like deer for example. And where hunting, and consequently eating meat, has a net gain on the economy. You believe that letting the deer run rampant and destroy the local wildlife is more sustainable than killing and hunting deer to keep them in check? That\'s irrational.\n\nThis argument is crazy considering for the most part it is hunters themselves who have wiped out natural predators from balanced ecosystems and controlled populations in the first place [https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/earth-talks-hunting/](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/earth-talks-hunting/)  And predators are being killed in order to keep populations high SO THAT THEY CAN BE HUNTED, not the other way around [http://www.ecowatch.com/colorado-mule-deer-hunt-2150892655.html](http://www.ecowatch.com/colorado-mule-deer-hunt-2150892655.html). Plus it\'s especially ironic that you bring up deer, since it is estimated that hunting them doesn\'t actually dent their numbers, since their biological cycles adapt to the population loss, and they start having bigger litters to compensate and due to a higher availability of food [https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-we-really-need-to-cull-deer-herds/](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-we-really-need-to-cull-deer-herds/). There are far more effective methods to control population growth such as birth control, predator reintroduction and sterilisation, which have an overall higher impact of wildlife numbers. It\'s ludicrous to imply that ""nature needs us"" or whatever to find balance, when it has done perfectly fine for millennia before we were here and that will continue to hold true for long after we are gone, and to suggest it\'s us who need to remedy it by interfering even more with the extremely complex balance of natural ecosystems... is ludicrous. Hunters hunt because it\'s fun, and they use the ""conservation"" excuse a posteriori to defend their hobby.\n\n>And what about all the carnivorous species on the planet? Are they destroying the environment? Even if humans decided to be vegan, many animals are not capable of such.\n\nEnvironmental destruction to the degree of human induced current upcoming environmental catastrophe was never an issue because humans weren\'t there before. I don\'t understand what you are trying to get at with this. I can\'t control what a lion in the African savanna eats just as I cannot prevent earthquakes. I can however, stop supporting one of the worst human-induced causes of environmental damage in our current climate, which is incidentally also probably one of if not the biggest way we can alter our behavior as individuals in a way that\'s remotely meaningful.\n\n>I think you need to rethink your assumptions. ""Eating meat is the worst     thing you can do for the environment"" just doesn\'t make logical sense.\n\nIt probably is the worst thing one can engage in at an individual level for the environment though, and if not the 1st worst thing, it\'s up there in the top 3 easily. If you think the contrary and claim what I\'m saying doesn\'t make logicla sense then explain why. Source me up. Put an actual argument forward and learn about this topic, because I am afraid it\'s porbably you who needs to rethink your (seemingly baseless, as you don\'t back up anything you say) assumptions.

So much so that you argue that the CO2 emissions should be counted as part of the cost of the animal consumption. Ok, that makes sense to me, that's why I listed my ideal life as raising my own animals to cut down on emissions.\n\n>Uh, no. Eating local barely reduces emissions from food production, and in the case of animal products is usually even more costly because of the inherent extra energy and resource cost of raising animals:\n\nExcept here where where apparently the evidence suggests that transportation amounts for such a low amount of total emissions that factory farming apparently becomes the most sustainable option. So I guess those 'huge amounts of fossil fuels used to carry the animals around' aren't huge at all, and the scale is actually off-setting a lot of the problems.\n\nOk, so which is worse?\n\n> Animal agriculture is responsible for around 18% of greenhouse gas emissions, which is more than all coming from transportation combined.\n\nYou've definitely convinced me that it is a larger problem, but even with these numbers it's clear that there are much worse sustainability issues out there. 18% doesn't seem that bad. Sure it's double that of plant based diets, but it's clear that it's impossible to feed humans without some level of carbon footprint.\n\nIf anything, this has me convinced that industrial waste is far more damaging than anything we do as individuals, which is kinda the point of the meme.\n\n>  Arguing that animals should be bred only for their waste potential is absolutely bonkers from a sustainability perspective\n\nOk, obviously you can tell I'm not saying that animals should be bred for their waste alone, I'm just saying that having my own chickens doesn't seem like it would be that bad.""}","{'subreddit name': 'sustainability', 'keyword': 'environment', 'body': ""> These two statements back to back are hilariously contradictory.

I do apologize about my tone if it was coming off as unnecessarily confrontational, and upon rereading I do see how it can be read as rude. Sorry about that. I will say though, you went into this conversation with kind of a defensive tone yourself, when in reality you yourself admitted you didn\'t know that much about the topic. I\'m not blaming you or anything, my tone wasn\'t right and that\'s on me entirely, but I recommend not reacting so strongly to stuff you may be ignorant about (and I don\'t use ignorant as an insult, I am ignorant of many things myself, and the only way to move past it is to learn and research, imo).\n\nAnyway, to sum up: Human population has grown wildly since the industrial revolution, with now over 7 billion people on earth, and this number is expected to grow to about 10 billion by the end of the century. Humans and the animals we keep for our consumption (including for food, cosmetic testing, clothing, etc.) make up around 98% of the biosphere. That\'s why lions eating their natural prey animals don\'t have an impact on the environment the way we do; they exists within an ecological niche that\'s balanced between prey and hunting animals. Humans, on the other side, don\'t exist in the wild ""naturally"" (at least for the most part). The amount of humans that exist nowadays, eating meat and animal products in the way that we do in the West is absolutely unsustainable long term, in the rawest sense of the world. We would need a whole second earth to feed the entire developing nations on a typical western diet (which are characterized by being very meat and animal product heavy compared to almost anywhere else).\n\nAbout this: ""So which is it, should we interfere? or not?""\n\nInterference is bad by industrialized societies because we break balanced ecosystems and then blame the native animals for it, creating the need to interfere (by hunting or other methods to control native fauna population). The goal is to interfere to a degree that our initial interference can be undone; help remedy the original ecosystem that wasn\'t fucked up in the first place. Sterilization and birth control are usually more effective than hunting, and beyond that, I\'m trying to make a point that hunters shield themselves with claims of ""conservation"" when in reality other effective ways exist that don\'t require killing innocent animals for sport... It\'s backwards logic; they create a fake explanation (claims of concern about conservation) to a behavior they didn\'t plan on changing from the beginning (hunting), instead of the other way around (looking for effective, long term solutions for the problem... hunting for sport can\'t be sustained if we really want native ecosystems to flourish again).\n\nLastly: I don\'t know how you feel about animal abuse or our responsibility regarding human rights abuses, but I recommend looking into that side of the story too, even though right now we are talking only about environmental concerns. The production of meat and dairy (even in ""small farms"", since almost all animals will eventually end up at the same slaughterhouses) requires huge amounts of animal ab/use, exploitation, and death that is, for virtually anyone capable of reading this comment, absolutely unnecessary. There are also rampant human rights violations at slaughterhouses, to the point that they are sometimes considered high risk jobs, and the workers have extremely high rates of injury as well as substance abuse, alcoholism, depression, anxiety, and PTSD from killing animals all day, and in communities where people work at such violent works, domestic violence usually skyrockets as well. Sadly, it\'s usually impoverished people and immigrants with very few choices who end up at this sort of job that no one really wants to do.\n\nMeat on a plate doesn\'t come without victims, both human and animal. I was very ignorant about this too, before I went vegan, when I said to myself that there was no way I would ever go vegan. But doing research and learning about all the harm in a single glass of milk made me change eventually.\n\nI\'ll leave you with some resources and documentaries in case you want to check them out. Some are more thorough than others, some are only an introduction to a very complex issue, but I think they\'re all worth checking out:\n\n* Cowspiracy (on Netflix), about the environmental harms of animal agriculture.\n* [Mic the Vegan analysis on the former documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpmTiHjUEBU), talking about criticism of it, from both the vegan and non-vegan side. Interesting watch if you enjoyed the docu film.\n* Seaspiracy (on Netflix), about the environmental harms of (industrial) fishing. Talks briefly about human rights concerns too.\n* Dominion (on YouTube). Australia based documentary showing the inner workings of factory farms, and what standard industry practice looks like. Has footage from ""humane"" and ""rspca approved"" slaughter, so you can check for yourself what those labels really mean. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQRAfJyEsko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQRAfJyEsko) \n* [Land of hope and glory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvtVkNofcq8) (on Youtube). UK based documentary on some of the largest factory farms in the UK, this one too showing footage from RSPCA approved and ""humane"" conditions.\n* Earthlings is a bit of an older one, but is based in the USA. Like the last two, shows footage from all sorts of factory farms and ""small farms"" and the like.

They look really bad but often these are prsented extremly misleadingly.\n\nFor example, look at land use, crazy right? But two thirds of all agricultural land is non-arable: it cannot support crops of any kind. All that will grow there is grass, and the only things that turn grass into food are animals. You can\'t just go out and plant rice or soy or oats in the kind of land used by cattle. Just like at this: [https://www.realcommercial.com.au/news/australias-second-largest-cattle-station-for-sale](https://www.realcommercial.com.au/news/australias-second-largest-cattle-station-for-sale) look at the photos of that 23,000 square kilometer cattle station. Even if you could grow rice or soy there, it\'s just not possible to turn that massive area into farms. Land used for cattle is done so because it cannot be used for anything else.\n\nSimilarly for water, since the land area is so massive that means a lot of rainfall falls on that land. Cattle then eat the grass that grows there and pee out excess water. 1L of milk does not contain 600L of water, I think we all know that. The vast majority of water that is ""used"" to make milk falls from rain onto the earth and then is absorbed, never touched by cattle. A small amount is abosrbed by the grass. Then, some portion of that grass is eaten by cattle. A portion of that becomes milk, and the rest is used by the cow or excreted back to the earth.\n\nWant to know how crazy this comparison is? Look at Bengu, the biggest dairy farm: 20,000 cows milked a day. According to these stats these cows use 125 billion liters of water per year. For comparisson, the entire amount of water in Sydney Harbor is 500 billion liters. In a few years these cows would drink the harbor dry.\n\nThere are legitimate reasons why eating animal products is bad, mainly ethical reasons, but I do not think these numbers truly reflect real problems.'}","{'subreddit name': 'sustainability', 'keyword': 'air', 'body': 'Remember, animal milk is for *babies* of the same species.

We apply the integrated assessment model MEDEAS-World to study four global transportation decarbonization strategies for 2050. The results show that a massive replacement of oil-fueled individual vehicles to electric ones alone cannot deliver GHG reductions consistent with climate stabilization and could result in the scarcity of some key minerals, such as lithium and magnesium. In addition, energy-economy feedbacks within an economic growth system create a rebound effect that counters the benefits of substitution.

Nations can be held hostage that way, it's not impossible. The real question is how long can it last and what price are misled patriots willing to pay?\n\nThere is also still a chance of China helping out. I'm not sure the CCP has officially announced sanctions and while it might be crazy for them to do so, it wouldn't be surprising to see them offer some sort of support to Russia. They might even wait to see how things evolve and start the same shit with Taiwan.\n\nCurrently, the sanctions announced by NATO countries and other allies will start hitting Russian economy slowly and it will be weeks if not months until it may result in a crippling state. But this also relies on all nations continuously applying pressure, even if it hurts - and some nations may not be able to do so and/or decide to soften their sanctions to lessen negative impact on their own economies. \n\nLess dependent nations will probably face less negative consequences overall, respectively stable economies will be able to rely on a solid foundation - while others may not be that lucky. It will require a lot of endurance and I'm not sure all nations will be capable in that regard.\n\nInterests also shift. It could be entirely possible that some nations consider siding with Russia as the conflict escalates, for whatever short-term benefits they might hope to gain. This doesn't necessarily mean they would join the conflict, but might indirectly still support it by offering help through other channels or by not complying with agreed sanctions - it has happened before.\n\nThese days, individuals also have a lot of money and assests which could be used to sponsor this - not just Russian oligarchs might have an interest in Putin's plans. So it could be possible, that despite sanctions (including frozen assets), they still get the needed funding from other sources. Really depends on how cash flow and imports can be limited. Russia is also fairly self-sufficient at this point, they have a lot of resources available.\n\nThere is also Putin's threat to make use of nuclear weapons - and I could see him do it if desperate enough.\n\nMost people today don't really want to face this, but Putin is an absolute lunatic and his vision to reanimate the USSR and maybe even rebuild the Russian empire has completely consumed him. Watching live streams of the House of Commons, Biden, Trudeau, and others, politicans across the globe seem to agree that Putin might not stop at Ukraine and continue to be the aggressor as he is trying to achieve his ultimate goal. \n\nThe hope is that these efforts are sabotaged before another country is invaded (hence the sanctions), but it's also a reminder that we are dealing with someone who is willing to sacrifice a lot more than just a handful of soldiers to gain hero status in future history books. \n\nIn other words, Putin might not care about sanctions, respectively economic pressure as much as we might assume.\n\nWould nukes solve this problem? Any rational human being would consider capitulation over starvation, and would also not consider using nukes - but Putin isn't rational.

We take a real image and prompt.     \n2. We add noise to this image, reducing it's quality.    \n3.

Each embedding is a list of numbers that carries the information contained within the sentence in a computer-meaningful format. Emebddings are created by training dual models to encode a sentence (create the embedding) and decode the embedding (recreate the original sentence).\n\n>The encoder and decoder are separate models,meaning if you already have an embedding, you can run it through the decoder to recover a sentence.\n\n>Now, embeddings aren't just for words. Images can also be encoded into embeddings. The really interesting bits happen when the image embedding and word embedding share a *latent space.* That is, the word embedding vector and image embedding vector are the same length and contain the same 'kind' of numbers (usually Real numbers, sometimes integers).\n\n>Let's say we have two encoders: one which vectorizes words to create embeddings, and one which vectorizes images to create embeddings in the same latent space. We feed these models 500 million image/caption pairs and take the dot-product of the caption embedding and image embedding for each caption embedding and each image embedding. Quick refresher on dot products, the larger they are, the more similar the vectors are.\n\n>Now, we have a matrix with 500 million rows and 500 million columns that contains the result of taking the dot product of all captions embeddings and all image embeddings. To train our model, we want to push the diagonal elements of this matrix (the entries where the caption corresponds to the image) towards infinity, while pushing the off-diagonal elements towards 0.\n\n>This is done by tweaking the parameters of the encoder models until the vector for the caption is numerically very similar to the vector of the image. In information terms, this means the models are capturing the same information from the caption text as they are from the image data.\nNow that we have embeddings, all we need is a decoder to turn the embeddings back into words and images.\n\n>**Now here is the kicker:** From the training process, we maximized the numerical similarity of the image and caption vectors. In real terms, this means the vectors themselves are the same length and each number in the vectors is close to the same. it doesn't matter if we send the text or image embedding to the decoder, since the vectors are the same. The decoder takes the embedding and does some math to turn it back into text or an image.\n\n>Now you should start to see how giving DALLE-2 some text allows it to generate an image. I'll skip over the guided diffusion piece, which is neat but highly mathematical to explain.\nDALLE-2 takes the caption you give it, encodes that into an embedding. It then feeds that embedding to a decoder. The decoder was previously trained to produce images from image embeddings, but is now being fed a text embedding that looks exactly like the image embedding of the image it describes. \n\n>So it makes an image, unaware that the image didn't previously exist.""}","{'subreddit name': 'europe', 'keyword': 'air', 'body': '>generate a Steampunk British Imperial Grand Strategy game?\n\nok had to try chatgpt : \n\nTitle: ""Empire of Steam: The British Raj""\r  \n\r  \nSetting: An alternate history where the British Empire has fully embraced steam technology, leading to a world where Victorian-era steam power coexists with advanced clockwork machinery and other fantastical Steampunk innovations.

Her sisters are located in the New Acropolis Museum in Athens. During the sacking of the Parthenon, by Lord Elgin, she, together with countless statues and archaeological artefacts were ‘stolen’ and eventually brought to Britain.\xa0\n\nCaryatids are female figures serving as supports. The most likely derivation of their name is from the young women of Sparta who danced every year in honour of Artemis Karyatis ('Artemis of the Walnut Tree'). This is one of six caryatids that held up the roof of the temple on the Acropolis known as the Erechtheion. She wears a peplos, a simple tunic pinned on each shoulder. Her hair is braided and falls in a thick rope down her back. She probably held a sacrificial vessel in one of the missing hands.  The figure strongly resembles the women of the east frieze of the Parthenon, which had just been completed when work on the Erechtheion began. She carries an architectural capital like a basket on her head.

She has said she is not opposed to the idea of unification **if that is what Moldovans really want**. You see, the thing is that the vast majority of Moldovans do not want unification and it's her job as president to represent the majority. Unionists on both sides have made it look like unification is a big deal for people on both sides, but it's really not. In fact, this whole unification thing is more useful to the pro-Russian camp, because they use it as a scarecrow by saying pro-EU politicians want to undermine the statehood of Moldova. \n\nThe real truth is that Moldovans don't need unification with Romania and couldn't care less about it. What they need is a way out of the shithole their corrupt leaders have dug them into these past 30 years. They need jobs, quality jobs to bring their workforce back home and to start building a real country, not a failed state that keeps bouncing around between East and West. \n\nRomania is not the answer to this. Romania is just a few powerhouse regions and cities dragging the rest of the country with them. The Romanian government is just sucking these regions dry by putting high taxes on work so it can maintain it's overweight inneficient and corrupt public sector.

There are hospitals full of cockroaches and ICU units catching fire because of the old and improperly maintained wiring, but doctors make at least €3500 per month so that's something, right? Judges who sentence some chicken thief to 4 years in prison but corrupt politicians who steal millions to 100 hours of community service end up with €5000 pensions.\n\nHere on /r/europe Romanians post articles about how Nicusor Dan won Bucharest or Dominic Fritz won Timisoara, but no one posts article about the pedophile mayor in some village who was reelected like the 4th time, or the other mayor who abused his daughter and posted it on facebook and was reelected as well. There are entire counties in Romania ruled by the same corrupt quasi-dictators for decades, where no legit investor dares to set foot and the few people left in those counties survive on welfare or minimum wage jobs. \n\nOf course, Moldova is just as bad and even worse than Romania in most aspects, but uniting with Romania wouldn't make things any better for them. They would still be ruled by the same types of fucks interested only in their own well being and not that of the community.

I always knew this day would come, but I never knew when. After every post, every comment, I ask myself ""is this the one? Will this be the piece of content to finally move someone to spend two bucks to make my experience on this app slightly better?"" That usually gets me thinking about the unique social dynamic Reddit\'s premium system fosters. Although most of their profits come from advertisers and their main product is us - the audience- it is interesting that the only product they provide for us to purchase is charity. It makes sense from a business perspective, as any free platform makes most of their money from a select group of high-spending users, their ""Whales"". However, standard premium memberships limit the spending capacity of each whale, since they can\'t buy themselves two premium memberships on the same account. However, by allowing them to provide that membership and recognition of quality to whatever other user they deem fit, Reddit allows the whales to spend as much as they want and keep the money flowing. This dependency on the altruism of Whales naturally draws some parallels to nature (pun intended). Nature\'s whales provide food, aid, and transport to all kinds of organisms, from the barnacle to the remora? But they are not essential to their survival. So too do the whales of Reddit help those who don\'t really need it but sure do appreciate it. Which brings me to my next point: the perceived value of gold and currency\'s worth in modern society. People often argue that money as a concept is manipulative because of its lack of inherent value, and that we should bring back some form of gold or silver standard. But that also presents a bit of a problem, because gold has no reason to be considered to be considered any more valuable than any other metal. Sure it looks nice, but what else has it got going for it? It\'s conductive, but I really doubt the gold sitting in Fort Knox is being used for circuitboards. It\'s not. It\'s only there to serve itself and sit around being valuable. And yet our entire world economy, and every system that depends on money, rely entirely on our perception that gold and currency hold value. What would happen if everyone decided to move on from gold? How would society collapse? What would end us first? Would we fight until there were none of us left? Would the collapse of every government bring about famine and disease, which would spread unchecked with no health organizations to stop it? Or would we mostly be fine, since most people are decent at heart? These apocalyptic hypotheticals entertain me, which is probably why I\'m so drawn to high-brow intellectual entertainment on the nature of man, like Undertale or Rick and Morty. Stories like those just shake me to my core, with their potent character moments and plot twists, and I really can\'t understand how people can criticize them. If you can\'t appreciate the quality storytelling, acting, music, and tone that these tales convey, I\'m sorry, but I will not weep for you. At that point, it\'s a choice you\'ve made to ignore high-class intellectual entertainment. On a lighter note, I do appreciate the resurgence in popularity of Undertale, Megolovania in particular. This is naturally due to the post-launch support the game is receiving, which is unprecedented in scale, quality, and haste among indie games, and games in general. Never, in the history of entertainment, ever, has a piece of media received a second part of the scale or quality Undertale has this quickly, and I don\'t expect it ever to be topped. The only piece of entertainment media I could see getting the treatment Undertale has is Rick and Morty, because of the intense care and effort put in by the entire creative team, day and night, nonstop, for intellectuals like me. With that said, I really think we should discuss the creative bankruptcy of the television and film industries, since Rick\'s quest for galactic redemption seems to be at odds with the whims of studio executives. Funding seems to be driving everything dangerously towards what will make a profit rather than what is artistically valuable. Take Illumination studios. They take classic tales like The Grinch and Sing and push out the most unremarkable product they can on the lowest budget reasonable, and then market like they\'re on borrowed time. You cannot escape the Illumination marketing team. They\'re everywhere. Your TV, your memes, your aunts, etc. I liked Despicable Me, I thought it was a fine film, Steve Carrell was great, but the marketing for the spinoff made me retroactively hate a movie that used to be a favorite of mine. Hopefully their studio burns down before they finish work on that Shrek reboot, because I cannot stand to see that (Academy Award Winning) series tarnished by such a morally corrupt corporation.'}","{'subreddit name': 'europe', 'keyword': 'air', 'body': 'Fair point.

People don’t seem to understand the nature of the fire.\n\nFrom what I can see from the photos and video, what has burned is the “charpente,” a set of rafters holding up the green lead roof. This is a tragedy, as the beams of the charpente were cut from massive oaks already centuries old in the Middle Ages, meaning some of them were growing in the time of Charlemagne. And the roof itself was a glorious structure, and appears to have collapsed and probably largely melted.\n\nHowever, none of these structures are visible from inside the cathedral. When you look up at the ceiling in the nave, you’re seeing stone vaulting. That vaulting is under the charpente, and doesn’t even touch it for the most part. The charpente and roof are like a big open barn or pavilion over the ceiling vaults.\n\nThe billion-dollar questions are: 1. whether the vaulting held up, and 2. Whether the main rose windows are damaged.\n\nIt is impossible to tell for certain, but I see no evidence yet that the vaulting has collapsed. Water from the hoses and molten lead from the roof may be getting through a bit into the nave, but the true interior of the church may be mostly safe from the flames. Certain works of art, like the statue of Mary, are directly under the center vault and vulnerable to such leakage or to falling stones; hopefully they have been moved to the sacristy as said on the news.\n\nAs for the rose windows, the South Rose appears, from our limited viewpoint, to certainly not be destroyed or melted. Whether it is warped or otherwise damaged is unclear, but it appears roughly intact and may be untouched. This is absolutely key, and wonderful news. More troubling is the cathedral’s greatest work of art: the North Rose. It is harder to see because it’s on the city side of the building rather than the river side; let us pray it is intact. If it survives, Notre-Dame as we know her can be almost entirely restored so far as visitors are concerned.\n\nAs for the spire, it was not the original. A sad loss, of course, and it looks like it crashed onto the western nave vaulting, which may have destroyed some of the ceiling, but it looked like it didn’t hit any windows.\n\nPeople are saying ridiculous things like it can’t be restored or that it’s totally destroyed. This is from a misunderstanding, I think. Even if the charpente, or frame, is totally burned, the cathedral can not only be saved, she can be restored to something looking like perfection.\n\nLet this tragedy be a call to raise the funds necessary to save the glorious treasure that is Notre-Dame; I am cautiously optimistic that even if the nave is full of molten lead we may have gotten off somewhat easy compared to what could have happened.\n\nEdit: Later photos I’ve seen so far seem to prove me correct about the vault and nave; the spire appears to have crashed through one segment of the vault where I thought it had, but the rest appears intact — even the ribs right around the hole! Really lucky spot for it to fall through, and good place for it to land: in the middle of the nave, near the transept. Cracks some unremarkable Revolution-era floor tiles and crushes some modern chairs. Misses the windows, vault ribs, clerestory, galleries and choir entirely. Lots of molten lead on top of the ceiling, but doesn’t look to have broken the vaulting anywhere else. Just have my fingers crossed about the rose windows.\n\nFurther edit: The North Rose is indeed intact! And I’m guessing the South Rose is as well, since I never saw any damage there. Notre-Dame will survive and flourish!

A thickness (on the top of the vault) around 10cm (4 inches) is not uncommon in western European churches. These vaults are the visible sealing of the church and not meant to carry anything. People told me more than once that if you would stand on a bad place on the arc you just fall through it. To make it more critical: If one part of the arc misses the entire vault (what in essence just a 3d arcis) can fall.\n\nThe wooden roof structure is meant to keep the weather (rain, wind, snow) away from those fragile vaults. At this moment is most of the roof burned. The burning coal lies on top of the arc. That here is some extra coal laying that arc is not great but stone doesn't melt easy.  \n\nI'll give my personal opinion as a structural engineer on the 3 most heard opinions that I heard:\n\n**Why don't the French throw a lot of water with a helicopter on top of the church to stop the fire?**\n\nA: The water is so heavy that the impact from the falling water on the arcs will let it collapse imidiately. At that point the Notre Dame is gone and you can start designing a new church.\n\n**Why isn't there a lot more water being put on the roof?** \n\nA: The fire is just not stoppable, the fire will burn all the wood. The philosophy used is: If there is no wood and coal left at that point the fire will stop. Extreme amounts of water only adds more stress on the arcs. Huge temperature changes can even break the bricks in the arc. The last reason is: A lot of the paintings on the inside of the church are made on the plaster on the arcs and walls. If there isn't anything left to burn why would you damage the rest of the church? Just to get a nice publicity on your spraying power? I expect that the primary focus was to get all the art out of the church as fast as possible and try to keep as much as possible from the interior intact.  \n\n**How can a fire “start” after working hours?**\n\nA: Sometimes with (for example) lead or bitumen repairs you need a high temperature to use it. Normally a big part of wood doesn't catch fire. If the wood catches fire underneath the part you were repairing there are many problems: you just don't see the fire so it can take quite a wile until you notice it. Extinguishing a fire under a cover of that sheet of metal/bitumen is also almost impossible. So it can acts like the start of a forest fire: a fire starts really small, it can hide under the ground for a long period and it can accelerate immensely. This doesn't exclude any other origin of the fire but fires during renovation have happened before with other churches.""}","{'subreddit name': 'europe', 'keyword': 'air', 'body': 'Wait a day or two.

More specifically how the uk at the time with Tony Blair in charge agreed to reduce and give up a large amount of the UK\'s rebate with the assurance and promise by France/The EU they\'d reform the CAP & reduce the amount France got etc... Well quelle surprise France/The EU lied and broke their promise, they did not stick to their end of the bargain and had shown that they never had any intention of reforming the CAP, yet the UK\'s smaller n reduced level of rebate has stayed in effect. And that duplicity by the french/the eu, the fact the eu shown that it cannot be and wont be reformed etc turned alot of Brits against the eu, later fueling Brexit votes.\n\n\n\n* Privatization and future re-nationalization(you see look at the uk now: Railways... **PRIVATIZED**, Buses...**PRIVATIZED**, Postal Service... **PRIVATIZED**,  Water... **PRIVATIZED**, Gas... **PRIVATIZED**, Electric... **PRIVATIZED**, Telecommunications... **PRIVATIZED**, North Sea Oil... **PRIVATIZED**, Education... **PRIVATIZED**, Prisons... **PRIVATIZED**, Welfare... **PRIVATIZED**, Healthcare/NHS.... **SOON TO BE PRIVATIZED** etc etc And yes i know it was and is the fault of many Tory governments that have done all this privatizing, but the problem is that the EU itself by law prevents member states from re-nationalizing anything. The EU requires & wants its members to privatize everything etc... So many left leaning people voted for Brexit to avoid n get out of that and allow the likes of Jeremy Corbyn to re-nationalize things at a later date(if he gets into power, which these left wing Brexiters want) ).\n\n\n\n* Not beholden to a foreign power, and not beholden to a foreign power who make the laws of the land.\n\n\n* Not having to take in any of Angela Merkel\'s \'refugees\'(who are currently swarming around continental Europe and desperate to get into the uk(and once they got their EU passports they\'d be allowed to come to the UK due to said Freedom Of Movement. I mean as an example well over 60% of the entire Dutch-Somali population has now moved to and lives in the UK once they got their EU passports etc!. Which seems absolutely insane to most Brexiters. Many Brexiteers want to avoid that ever happening again).\n\n\n* Austerity(now in the uk the poorest in the country have for yeeeears been hit with, savaged and hammered by austerity... And thus Brexit was seen as a oppurtunity to get back at and say \'fuck you\' to the government & political establishment(who were all 99% supporting remain). Brexit was used as a protest vote basically.\n\n\n* Sovereignty.\n\n\n* Unsustainable levels of mass-immigration(of which the UK populace was always against & disagreed with, and yet the British people were never once asked or consulted with regarding if they wanted near non-stop mass-immigration. The powers that be ignored them abd carried on with the policy cuz it benefitted them & their friends in high places etc.. And well it all came back to haunt them, backfired by causing Brexit. You can only ignore and stomp all over the people for so long before something gives, in this case it was Brexit).\n\n\n* No more freedom of movment and no more being overrun by poor, non-educated, low skilled Poles/Eastern Europeans(there is 1 million+ of these Poles alone in the uk since Poland joined the eu in 2004, madness!. Simply waaaaay too many, too fast in the minds of Brexit voters).\n\n\n* The resentment caused by Tony Blair\'s desire for and championing of EU expansion to the East and then not protecting Britain from the massive immgration boom(and in general Tony Blair\'s instigating of mass immigtration from the 3rd world to create more Labour voters and(i quote) ""to rub the right\'s nose in diversity"") etc is what caused Brexit. He and his Labour cronies to a certain extent personally caused Brexit in the minds of most Brexiters.\n\n\n* No more subsidizing(to the tune of billions every year) these ungrateful, hypocritical mooching Eastern European dumps.\n\n\n* Ability for the uk to strike its own trade deals, that suit it better.\n\n\n* Not involed in any EU army nonsense.\n\n\n* No more unelected politicians.\n\n\n* Actual democracy in the uk and not the democratic deficit seen in the EU.\n\n\n* To fight back and stick to the globalists(which the EU is a part of their project).\n\n\n* The power for the uk to regain control of its bountiful fisheries and not have them continually raped n pillaged by the EU/Spain/France and others etc.\n\n\n* Prior to Brexit David Cameron went to The EU seeking reform and an perminant exemption to Freedom Of Movement for the UK, yet his requests were ignored and shot down, fell on deaf ears in Brussels as The EU once again had shown it wasnt willing to reform and or listen to the uk, not willing to take the uk\'s special circumstances into consideration etc... This also made many Brits choose to vote for Brexit as it became apparent that it would be a waste of time staying in and trying to change the EU.\n\n\nSo that\'s the reasons why.

I was far more impacted by my close contact with people who had lived their whole lives very far away from and in some ways, very different than the only way I had ever known.

Now that I\'m this far removed from my life 40 years ago, I can see how very different things are now.  Besides being constantly challenged a fantastical yearning that the things that made it so great could somehow return, my healthy ability to reason swiftly reminds me that it will absolutely never happen.  And with that, I have only to manage what feels like mourning the death of the great decades of the \'60s, \'70s and \'80s.\n\nAnyway, your mention of 40 years also reminded me that the population of the world was only about half of what it is now.  I researched it, and a top internet hit tells us the world population in 1979 was 4.4 billion.  It\'s currently 7.6 billion, which works out the world population now about 72% larger than 40 years ago.  That in itself tells us just how different the world and it\'s people were.\n\nI suppose certain cities have been highly congested with people for centuries.  I doubt Amsterdam was nothing but a quiet, peaceful town of locals waving hi to each other as they passed on their way to work.\n\nWhen I was 6, my family moved to Solana Beach, in north county San Diego.  It was December of \'70.  We moved into a big house 3 miles from the beach in a neighborhood just finished Phase I of its development.  The intersection at the area\'s shopping center had 4-way stop signs.  If one traveled 2 miles on almost any direction, one would be in ""the country"", the land untouched by humans.  Fast forward to that same intersection now, and at most times throughout the day, it\'s such a traffic nightmare, it can take over 5 minutes just to get through it.  And the same is the case for the beaches, the freeways, the fact that it might take traveling many miles before one can find a quiet peaceful area of undeveloped countryside.  Point being...being that part of me knows my home town is nothing like it was when I was a kid, that those memories I cherish are literally of not just a time that no longer exists, but a place as well.  My point is that it\'s not just tourists who can ""ruin"" (destroy the way it once was) a place.  It\'s just that there are nearly twice as many people on the planet than there were if we\'re old enough to have memories of the late \'60s.\n\nIn realizing that the increasing population is doing that all over the world, our future isn\'t looking very bright as a species.  I feel quilt when I remember I\'ll probably die before the world\'s population makes life for so many unpleasant in ways people haven\'t yet known.  The collective mentality of the world population is changing for the worse as well.  So many people have become what I call ""dramaholics"" (addicted to drama).  They\'re obsessed with all the negativity published in the news day after day after day.  And when one of the most negative, shallow valued, simple and selfish minded people on the planet somehow gets elected as president of the most ""powerful"" nation in the world, then we can be sure the world has changed for the worse.  If any American, regardless of political party they support was given an in depth description of what the country might be like and the character details of a future president, I\'m quite confident Republicans and Democrats alike would say it\'s impossible, the wholesome American spirit could never allow that.  They wouldn\'t believe it possible for so many to turn cold, unthinking and foolish.\n\nToo many are defaulting to a negative disposition out of the gate as they visit their normal social media pages.  They read an article, read some comments, and do exactly that they did the day before and that day before that and so on, for the last few years now.  It\'s commonplace now, for these comments sections to be a broken record of negative exchange between people who don\'t even know the other person as a person.  They see, just you do if you\'re reading this, nothing but words.  What once was a live person conversation, looking in their eyes, feeling their posture, feeling their humanness, is dramatically reduced to literally a black and white digital technology conveying often unthought, ego-based sub-component of their thought-life.  Too rare do we come to social media share the solution.  We only express and thus promote the problem.  And that\'s all that ever happens...the problem just grows and grows.  And the problem is simply looking at any subject negatively.  We individuals might not believe were as significantly influenced by the most people mindset of the population, but I\'m convinced we are.  I got sucked into the negativity as well.  I didn\'t realize how much I had changed until I had been doing it for months.  And...when I realized I was depressed, doubtful, lonely, and that that was virtually the polar opposite of the way I was not too many years ago.\n\nThen I realized I can\'t blame anyone else for my thoughts and feelings. I committed to completely eliminate any and all negative news from my conscious focus.  I disciplined myself to not even read the headlines.  The goal, was to keep myself oblivious to the petty minded drama and negativity that underlies virtually all news articles today.   I did this, because something tells me the world in some ways, is identical to the way it\'s always been.  Peace, joy, humor, love, and clarity to see that at any given moment, there is an abundance of everything  we need to be just as amazed and awestruck about the miracle of life as there ever was.  If people aren\'t inspiring us, let\'s inspire ourselves, become an example of promoting the solution, and because positive energy is more powerful in the ultimate sense (love is more powerful than fear), when we insist upon peace, joy, and connectedness with all that good, true, and valuable, we have no choice but to increase one of the most powerful and valuable elements of human nature - inspiration itself.'}","{'subreddit name': 'europe', 'keyword': 'air', 'body': 'No offence, but the US is a depressingly low bar. \nAlso comparisons with other european countries seems more fair as the political situations are more comparable, as are our oil and natural gas reserves.'}","{'subreddit name': 'europe', 'keyword': 'environment', 'body': ""The speed limit is not for climate change (though it helps), it's for protecting the environment and health concerns (i.e. lowering NO, not CO2).""}","{'subreddit name': 'europe', 'keyword': 'air', 'body': 'This is probably a revealing Freudian slip.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThree psychologists are having dinner.\n\nThe first says: ""Something funny happened last night at dinner.

They simply did not agree with the ideology itself, they felt that they were poor because they didn't make the right choices to do better in life.

I think it included things like dancing around maypoles and copying Latin manuscripts. At some point Thor might have been involved. That civilization is dead. It summoned an alien entity from beyond the void which devoured its summoner and is proceeding to eat the rest of the world.\n> \n> An analogy: naturopaths like to use the term “western medicine” to refer to the evidence-based medicine of drugs and surgeries you would get at your local hospital. They contrast this with traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurvedic medicine, which it has somewhat replaced, apparently a symptom of the “westernization” of Chinese and Indian societies.\n> \n> But “western medicine” is just medicine that works. It happens to be western because the West had a technological head start, and so discovered most of the medicine that works first. But there’s nothing culturally western about it; there’s nothing Christian or Greco-Roman about using penicillin to deal with a bacterial infection. Indeed, “western medicine” replaced the traditional medicine of Europe – Hippocrates’ four humors – before it started threatening the traditional medicines of China or India. So-called “western medicine” is an inhuman perfect construct from beyond the void, summoned by Westerners, which ate traditional Western medicine first and is now proceeding to eat the rest of the world.\n> \n> “Western culture” is no more related to the geographical west than western medicine. People who complain about western culture taking over their country always manage to bring up Coca-Cola. But in what sense is Coca-Cola culturally western? It’s an Ethiopian bean mixed with a Colombian leaf mixed with carbonated water and lots and lots of sugar. An American was the first person to discover that this combination tasted really good – our technological/economic head start ensured that. But in a world where America never existed, eventually some Japanese or Arabian chemist would have found that sugar-filled fizzy drinks were really tasty. It was a discovery waiting to be plucked out of the void, like penicillin. America summoned it but did not create it.

With an emission of 2.5kg CO2 per liter jet fuel that's 1.35 tons for the round trip. \n\nWe now have to multiply that number with a factor X because CO2 released into the high atmosphere has a larger greenhouse gas effect than CO2 released at ground level. Having an X between 2 and 3 is the most common on websites that try to calculate the CO2 emissions of air travel.\n\n\n> we'd be much better off challenging the corporations and governments than trying to guilt consumers into not flying etc\n\nYou know what governments will do? They'll get rid of the fuel tax exemption for airlines, and introduce a CO2 tax. And instead of guilting you to not flight, they would make it less affordable. \n\nIf we get rid of the tax exemption, the price for that roundtrip would increase by 420€. Jet A1 has a fuel tax of 654.50€ per 1000 liter, on top of that there's 19% VAT. And if we add a CO2 tax of 86 Euro per ton (like Switzerland) the price would increase by an additional 115 Euro. That's 535 Euro.

They don\'t want to be seen as hippies for wearing dreads, or as ghetto for having braids, they want to have nice hair and feel beautiful and empowered, and to be recognised as such. Ironically, something like braids were a ""serious"" or neutral alternative to ""natural"" hair or dreadlocks, and are/were used as status markers in the black community, because it takes time and resources to maintain, but that seriousness disappears when the dominant white culture gives them new meanings in a wider context. \n\nThere are always people who take these issues too far, but if anyone pretends that this is strictly an issue for insane SJW tumblrites, they\'re not really listening to the actual arguments.

We are on the verge on healthcare collapse (like in Lombardia in early 2020) and recent abortion ban prompted up to a million (!) people to go to the streets to protest. The protests targeted the government and Polish church that has great ties with the government.\n\nEven though in Constitution it’s said that there is a divide between state and church, it is bogus. The religion influences the government and tried to instill its morality upon all people.\n\nAnd Polish church is corrupt and borderline evil. Yesterday, Vatican released a long raport where we can learn, among some others, about Stanislaw Dziwisz - archbishop and personal secretary of pope John Paul II. It says the the pope knew about pedophilia and didn’t to anything about it. And Dziwisz was taking bribes and was a friend with McCarrick who sexually used dozens, if not hundreds of children. \n\nBack to the protests. People were protesting for women’s right for abortion - the new law says that for example you cannot terminate a pregnancy because of Down’s syndrome. But it was also rage against hate for LGBT, disfunctioning healthcare (and gov saying it’s all doctors fault!), rampant propaganda and Kaczyński (who is like a dictator in his party and gov) and also against church and its interference in peoples lives.\n\nSo, some people sprayed some paint on churches, some peacefully entered churches to hold banners etc. They protested without violence. And mind you, we are close to a total lockdown and churches will probably still be open when everything is closed. When nationalists saw „the attacks”, they organized to try to „defend” the churches. They basically stayed in front of churches and sometimes beat random people with banners… And when people from the protests saw that, they decided to not confront with them because again - those are peaceful protests.\n\nAnd why nationalists took to the streets against the pro-abortion protests? Kaczyński released a video in which he called every patriot to defend the church and country. It sounded like Jaruzelski in ’81 when he announced Martial law! So nationalists and hard conservatives thought that they and their country were being attacked. \n\nSo the Polish governments alliance with nationalists was strengthened again. And I think they felt stronger and thought - fuck it, let’s make some noise. Or something else. I don’t know. They do it every year on Independence Day. I guess they just don’t know how to do anything else. And this time they burned an appartment.\n\nPlease remember that Polish government are a bunch of fascist and xenophobic people.

Indeed I have often said that, were I to try my hand at politicking from the opposite side of the aisle as they say, that is, as a liberal Democrat, my adulations would flow freely from all sides and I would be esteemed a most capable and intelligent man by those who even now staunchly oppose my every endeavor; however, as a conservative Republican, I find it necessary to go to great lengths to establish my credentials as an educated man i.e., my education at Wharton and the academic excellence I achieved there, the great success I have had in the worlds of real estate and business, as attested by the accumulation of material wealth under the Trump business empire, et cetera, et cetera. As I say, I habitually provide these credentials because of the great, and I do not believe I go too far in saying unfair, degree of cynicism visited on all claims of intellectual prowess by those hailing from a more conservative worldview.\nAt any rate, returning to the idea of nuclear power, my uncle spoke with me some score and fifteen years hence and gave me to understand of the vast potential of such advances, the tremendous power of the atom--he explained this all to me so long ago, and history has proven the veracity of his prognostications. One might wonder at who could have foreseen such things so long ago; who indeed but a man of clairvoyance and sagacity such as my uncle.\nNow, if you will allow my to shift focus for a moment on these four prisoners, these same prisoners who, until recently, were numbered three. Both in the past and succeeding into the present time, my advice, gentlemen--and here I hope you will forgive me for using the masculine form of address, as it his been my experience that, while the intelligence of the feminine sex is not to be rivaled, most men in a position of power seem not to have been made privy to this fact, and may yet nor for some six score years or more I daresay--my advice is that, the messenger is of utmost importance.

He went back out of a sense of patriotism and duty. His meaning in life is to do whatever he can to make Russia a freer, more democratic place, and he knows he would be instantly discredited by taking asylum somewhere. He\'s already constantly accused of being a CIA/NATO puppet. He is genuinely willing to pay with his life for his cause. \n\nThe investigations that the FBK does, the circus that he creates, and the courage that he shows are excellent foils to United Russia and Putin. His team is fantastic at showing how corruption affects people\'s daily lives, and just how soulless United Russia are. There\'s a reason Putin has never said his name in public, not even once. There\'s joke in Moscow that if you want something fixed/cleaned up by the city, all you have to do is write his name on it, and it\'ll be done immediately. If Putin wasn\'t deathly afraid of him, he wouldn\'t have tried to kill him, he wouldn\'t have arrested the people that went to Vnukovo to meet him, he wouldn\'t have diverted his plane to Sheremetyevo, he wouldn\'t have arrested him in the airport, and he wouldn\'t denied his lawyer access to him. You don\'t do those things to someone you don\'t view as a threat. Navalny certainly wanted today to be a circus. Putin cares deeply about geopolitics, and Navalny forced him to look like a clown today. Navalny makes Putin look like a small coward. He branded Putin\'s party as the ""Party of Crooks and Thieves"", effectively. \n\nNavalny knows he wouldn\'t be able to make the same kind of difference abroad, and being an exiled dissident just isn\'t who he is. He knows the risks of coming back perfectly well. Being in Russia is the only hope he has at affecting change. I would also wager that he\'s betting the global stardom he\'s cultivated after the poisoning might save him. It very well might not, and he might be sent away to prison for a long time/ killed (he very well could be killed. It\'s difficult to predict what Putin will do backed into this kind of corner), but there would likely be huge political and economic consequences for Russia to pay. The EU has its new Magnitsky Act, the USA has theirs,  the pipeline to Germany is already under huge scrutiny, there are Duma elections in the fall, there\'s the situation in Belarus, the protests in Khabarovsk, etc... Putin has a tremendous amount to lose by doing something to him. Again, I\'m not saying that will stop him, but it\'s not as simple as some in this thread make it out to be.\n\nAs an aside, I really wish people would dispense with the idea that Putin is some kind of omnipotent criminal mastermind. He\'s not. He\'s good at crafting a state propaganda-based image, seizing opportunities, and using the toolbox he has. The thing he\'s best at is stealing. Also, Russia is an authoritarian state, not a totalitarian one. In an authoritarian state, you get by by avoiding politics, letting those at the top pillage the country, and make the best of your circumstances. In a totalitarian state, every single action is political, you must be constantly loyal to the party, and you risk everything by doing anything less.

Search for flag or estelada.\n\n________\n\nSpanish authorities are facing a backlash after Barcelona supporters were forced to ditch yellow T-shirts ahead of the club\'s Spanish Cup final victory over Sevilla.\nSeveral television stations showed pictures of police forcing Barça fans to discard their yellow T-shirts before entering the Wanda Metropolitano stadium in Madrid ahead of the 5-0 thrashing of Sevilla that earned the Catalan club a 30th Copa del Rey victory.\n\nMany Catalans -- including Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola whose ribbon has resulted in a fine by English football authorities -- have been donning yellow to show support for nine Catalan independence leaders held in prison near Madrid over ""rebellion"".\n\nThey face up to 30 years in jail if convicted of that charge.\n\nA police spokesman told AFP on Sunday that ""placards or T-shirts whose significance or content could have increased the risk of public order problems or violence in and around the stadium were seized"".\n\nBarça have often played a significant role in the Catalan independence movement supported by many of their fans. The club is seen by many as a bastion of resistance against Madrid domination, not just on the football field but in political halls too.\n\nBarça centre-back Gerard Pique has been jeered many times by Spain fans while wearing the national team jersey over his open support for a referendum on Catalan independence.\n\nSaturday\'s measures sparked anger in Catalonia.\n\n""Inexplicable. We\'re a club that defends freedom of expression,"" said Barça chairman Josep Maria Bartomeu after the game, adding that he would demand an explanation from the Spanish Football Federation.\n\n""If now, a simple colour is an offence to the State, where are we going?"" former Catalonia president Carles Puigdemont tweeted from Germany where he is in self-imposed exile to avoid a Spanish arrest warrant.\n\n""Banning yellow in a football stadium is absurd and ridiculous, and an unacceptable attack on freedom of expression,"" said pro-Catalan independence association Omnium Cultural.\n\nSocial media users reacted with irony, asking if the match officials for the cup final would also have their jerseys taken from them as they were wearing yellow.\n\nSome Barcelona fans jeered the Spanish national anthem and the watching King Felipe VI ahead of Saturday\'s match.\n\nA goal from Argentine superstar Lionel Messi and two from Uruguay international forward Luis Suarez helped Barça cruise to victory.'}","{'subreddit name': 'europe', 'keyword': 'environment', 'body': 'People are pissed off that these corporations are enabled to continue wrecking the environment while their own government is using their Tax payer money to protect these criminals.\n\nDespicable.'}","{'subreddit name': 'europe', 'keyword': 'dust', 'body': ""One of them is using his respirator, and well he should because that dust is [bad](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0144.html).\n\nThe other 2 don't seem too, so I suspect their superiors think they're disposable and didn't bother telling them about the dangers they're exposed to.""}","{'subreddit name': 'europe', 'keyword': 'dust', 'body': 'Given that these troops are protecting the fossile industry from the will of the people...
