                "comment_text": "I don't mean to rain on your parade. You just might need to save a lot more money than you initially thought.\n\nThe average cost of building a standard box house is approximately $125/sqft. Being that a severe weather proof, bullet proof, quake proof, fire proof, highly insulated, self-sufficient and independently powered dome bunker would need to be built by a specialist... you'd probably be looking more in the range of [$400-450/sqft](http://www.dometech.com/content/Services/RequestQuote.aspx).\n\nSo, in order to stay within your $500k budget... you're lookin' at a 1250 sqft bunker... which is about a 40' wide dome to house everything you need: bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen, storage.... which is about the size of a large 1 bedroom apartment. If you take into account food, water and equipment storage for a lengthy apocalypse, I'd think at least 100-200 sqft would be dedicated to food, depending on how many people you're housing. Then you have to take into account the cost of a massive, longterm generator or solar power system.\n\nA plain wooden fence cost me $15,000 to install last year around my 12,000sqft property. If you're looking at a security fence to surround your property... assuming you have a firing range and airstrip... you'd at least a few acres? Even a [chain link fence](http://www.chdist.com/displayproductdetail.do?skuSearch=3604400&mr:referralID=NA&baseItemOID=98338&mr:trackingCode=1931DFF4-659D-DE11-93DB-0019B9C043EB&itemGroupOID=98338&sku=3604400&cid=cse_goog) around a 2 acre property, with a 3584.8' perimeter... you're lookin' around $80,000-100,000 for the fence alone.\n\nSo, let's say you want to ditch the airstrip idea and get a smaller fence ($50k). You have $450k to work with. Which is now an 800-1000sqft dome... with 100-200sqft of supplies. Which leaves you with 600-800sqft of living space. Take out the 50sqft for the bathroom and another 50 for the kitchen, you're now down to 500-700 sqft of living space. Which is a small studio apartment. I dunno about you, but I'd have 5-10 people with me if there were an apocalypse... and I wouldn't want to try to live longterm in that small of a space.\n\n**TL;DR - I'd be looking at a budget closer to $1.5-2mil if I were going to do this project the way you want it to be done.**\n\nWhat can I say... I have a thing for numbers and I too have a lot of free time on my hands..."
