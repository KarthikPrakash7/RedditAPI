"Actually now that I think about it, the general air quality may or may not be better outside of the US.  In many places outside of the US, they still heavily rely on coal in power plants because their environmental regulations are not as stringent as here in the US."

"Understood, which is why I'm trying to find lists of ""top cities, towns, etc.. with the cleanest air"".  There is no such thing as a city completely devoid of pollutants, but hopefully I'll be able to locate one that can at least come close to it.

Is there an airnow European counterpart?"

It's going to be difficult to find a place that isn't in some way impacted by air pollutants. Every country has industrial facilities that are needed to manufacture basic necessities.  Air pollution is inevitably a by-product of that.

"That is a good site but I'm looking to potentially relocate to Europe.  Seems there's high ozone levels around the Mediterranean coast which is a concern (the wifey would like to be close to a beach).

I think Ireland could be nice but they are experiencing issues with particle pollution.  This has been really hard trying to find a nice clean place to live."

I 2nd the suggestion to use airnow.gov. I’m an environmental engineer focused on air pollution from industrial facilities.

If you are located in the US states and cities have that data present on their environmental quality board webpage. EPA has airnow.gov but most of the time will send you to the state/territory info.

How close are you to an industrial site OR to a busy road?

But polluted air literally gets inside.

Just for that reason people wear masks outdoors because indoors they have air purifiers and of course they manage not to emit any pollution indoors.

"Because we spend 90% of our time indoors, improving the quality of the air we breathe has a direct impact on our comfort, health, well-being, and productivity. Fresh air improves our ability to reason, retain information, and maintain focus. Fresh air also restores energy, relieves stress, and creates a happier, calmer state of mind.   
As a result, indoor air quality in office buildings has an impact on everyone's comfort and health. Learn more about the [importance of air quality in offices](https://www.75f.io/blog/importance-of-indoor-air-quality-in-the-workplace) and why business owners should be concerned about its impact on productivity and profitability."

And it is only the level of 'visible' pollution

"Purpleair.com is an alternative aggregator of personal air quality data.   

For mix of pollution and covid, the n95 or kn95 masks are best. 

 There are ""n95"" masks with a charcoal (activated carbon) packs and vents which is good for pollution and bad for covid.  

I've been able to get n95 from Costco before, in case the other places don't work out."

"Hey, pretty sure indoor air quality guidelines / concentration levels have not been released by WHO for pm2.5 or pm10. Indoor air quality is still an emerging area. I think the argument could be made that the ambient outdoor levels should apply indoors as well though if helpful. 
Also for more on Indoor air quality you should have a read of the IAQMs new guidance: https://iaqm.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/iaqm_indoorairquality_v4_consultation_draft.pdf
May have something useful in..."

"Ok. Keep in mind that air quality is dynamic and not static which means that you need to invest in continuous monitoring of the air in order to determine the quality. Unfortunately, 1h of data is not enough to come to a conclusion."

"Hi, so sorry to hear that you have an irresponsible neighbor.
You could detect but not with conventional air quality monitors. There are some companies that could send you a kit of special cartridges that absorb chemicals in the air. Later you send them back to the laboratory for analysis. 
Which country are you from?"

It’s very sad that summers are not as they used to be in the past. Lots of wildfires and smoke.

"PA-II doesn’t measure Ozone only particulate matter. 

The number vary because weather conditions may move pollution around, sometimes towards the monitor sometimes away from the monitor."

"The point is....they ARE going to tap the grid.  They just don't have the connection yet.  They have access to a power pole on the property next to the cell site.  They are simply running a diesel generator because they don't care about pollution, and that needs to be publicized.  

Thanks for the comment."

Plitvice is one of the coolest places I’ve ever been. Glad to hear the air quality is great too.

"I am an air quality engineer.  My job consists of calculating air pollutant emission rates from various industrial processes (including diesel generators), running dispersion models to determine where pollutants will end up, and compiling that information into air quality permit applications so that companies may obtain air quality permits.  In some cases, facilities are exempt from air quality permitting requirements. 

So long as the facility is either exempt or has obtained an air quality permit, they will continue to operate."

It is but this is second season in a row of nasty smoke pollution in the Sierra’s and its better to know your air quality and get air purifiers while hopefully longer term solutions are implemented.

Ah. There are devices like IQAir or the Awair Element that show you how polluted your air is.  Unfortunately these are becoming a necessity out here in California during fire season.

"I do not have an air moniter, i've never even heard of it"

Yes that sounds like the effect is of air pollution.  For me its definitely sore throat and some affects that feel like a cold.  Also a headache.  BTW I am currently in the California Sierras so getting it worse here. Do you have an air monitor?

Granted the pollution may have gone up due to more idle vehicles but is the solution really to allow vehicles to cut along more residential streets and make it easier for people to drive in London? This is only going to encourage more people into their cars. We do need to think more carefully about the impact that LTNs have on nearby roads and take a more holistic approach but it’s important to remember that pollution was bad before LTNs and if nothing changes it will continue to get worse. Allowing more cars into more parts of London is not the solution.

"I used this tool to see what the fire activity in northern russia typically looks like in July, and it's definitely the right season for wildfires in that area.  Could be smoke?

"hey as I said I live in developing asian country so the services here are terrible 

I called the ecology ministry hot line and they do not even have device which checks quality  of air (  I mean they told me technically they may have it but it works only in dry weather which makes no sense since we feel the smell only in wet weather )"

No winds. Stability doesn't help air quality

"Why is Michigan, surrounded by lakes, so terribly fucked. The air quality is not breathable, you literally can’t go outside in the lower penninsula"

Happy to help.  I work as an air quality engineer.

"I work as an air quality engineer.  Basically my job is calculate which types of air pollutants are released by an industrial facility and then calculate how much of each one is released.  I also help these facilities work with state environmental protection agencies to get them air quality permits.

The process of getting an air quality permit is very rigorous and often involves conducting air pollutant dispersion modeling to show where pollutants will end up.  Depending on the type of air quality permit being developed by the state agency, there are often comment periods which are open to the public where members of the public can ask questions and/or raise concerns. 

I would contact your state agency, whoever it is, ask them which major facilities are located near you, and see if you can get on some sort of distribution list to be notified when the facility is going through permit actions so that you may have your comments submitted as part of the public comment period."

"An air purifier inside the home, something with carbon filters for VOCs and HEPA for particulates - a positive pressure system would be even better, but is more bulky and difficult to install. 

3M do a furry tape that you can use to seal drafts on doors and windows to ensure pollution doesn’t get in but make sure to open a window for 15-20 mins each afternoon otherwise CO2 levels can get too high (assuming you don’t have a positive pressure system). 

NASA has some interesting research on plants that can help to filter air, although generally you’re better off with a machine. But as a supplement they’re a nice choice, and help psychologically too if you can’t get outside. 

If the toxic air persists it may be worth checking with local regulations to see if they are breaking the law. There may be local air quality campaign groups or a local government department you can raise the issue with. Fixing the problem instead of the outcome is usually better and helps all your neighbors too."

How about these experts focus on eliminating toxic fumes from our air rather than tell us to eat more fiber. Glad the research is being done though.

Lots of conventional knowledge floating around as science. Tress don't do much against PM2.5 but the people seem to think planting more trees will negate the effects of air pollution

"Hello, everyday new studies come to the surface as scientists take a closer look into the matter. 
I have written various books in the subject (even for kids) in my effort to educate the public about the danger it poses to human health. 

It is very important to share with our close relatives/friends everything we learn regarding air pollution in order to make a difference. 

Wood smoke, traffic pollution and other anthropogenic sources of air pollution are very toxic because of the nature of the particles if we are talking about particulate matter PM2.5 or PM1.

Stay safe and take care of your newborn."

"Hi, 

Thank you for listening to the podcast.

I am the host of the interview.
I am an expert in air pollution and I have experience in the field. Unfortunately, the LTN in his area has the opposite effects as the queue that is formed outside his house in tremendous. Cars are unable to move which have even bigger impact to air quality because the incomplete combustion of the fuels. It is well studies that when a vehicle idles, it produces lots of pollutants like carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide because the necessary temperature in the engine isn’t achieved. 
Pollution is invisible to the untreated eye. 
We can easily smell NO2 as it has a particular pungent odour."

"I have raised this issue of particle composition to the World Health Organizations when commenting on their draft revisions of The Who Air Quality Guidelines.  As a start, we need to add supplementary standards for key markers for the most toxic PM2.5 components, like fossil fuel burning PM (from sources like coal combustion and diesel traffic):   particle sulfur and elemental carbon soot."

"Interesting! It's not surprising that some toxins would be more harmful than others, but the type of particle is not discussed very often in the context of air quality. It should be!"

The interviewer says that he is 100% convinced that pollution has gone up on the interviewees street based on video evidence. How is that possible when you can’t see particulate matter or NOx gases? If there has been an increase in traffic levels then how do we know that is due to the LTN? Most studies have shown that LTNs do not increase pollution in adjacent streets but encourage more people out of their cars

This level of pollution is visible with the naked eye so I think it is mistaken or an error with the sensors or maybe some lit a cigarette right next to the sensor.

"Interesting, but annoying that they don't properly cite or link the original study. I believe they are talking about this one: [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412012000566](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412012000566)  


""Other things held equal, a 1% increase in tonnages of air Pb released 22 years prior raises the present period aggravated assault rate by 0.46% (95% CI, 0.28 to 0.64). Overall our model explains 90% of the variation in aggravated assault across the cities examined.""

Focusing on PM2.5 as a whole, without taking its composition into account, is an unfortunate limitation of today's understanding of PM2.5.  But, low toxicity particles can be very prevalent, while the high toxic ones can be very rare. This is why it makes sense to look at the impacts of PM2.5 in the aggregate.  Today's understanding of PM2.5 on health has enabled the creation of legally binding regulations which has limited it emission and improved health for many populations.

The future of this work is to 'go beyond mass' and conduct research which allows us to limit the emission of the more toxic particle types.

The evil influence of industry which you speak of has happened in the last. Defending sugar in diets is one great, and hugely tragic, example.

But it is not happening to this extent with regards to particulate air pollution. Coal power plants are being shut down in many countries.  The transition from fossil fuels is happening.

Lastly, the academics who are leading this field are paid well and by their own governments. They are left to do their work independently. They are mostly preoccupied with their own egos. By this I mean, they only care about being known more than the others. And, they only way you can achieve this is by being correct in the long term."

"Yes, a lot of Middle East/African countries would rather not share their AQI data (because it is generally terrible). Try entering your city in https://www.iqair.com/, they have a lot more personal air quality monitors, as well as modeled AQI data. 

And yes there are few ""N95s"" on Amazon that aren't fakes. NYTimes had an article the other week about how to find real ones online. Good luck!"

"Surgical masks do virtually nothing as the seal is not tight enough for PM2.5 particles. You need an N95. KN95 are an alternative choice, but not as good. Check hardware stores, you might find a few for sale.

Pollution levels change frequently based on air movement - check the pollution levels daily at [aqicn.org](https://aqicn.org) to see whether it's recommended to wear a mask or not."

"Carbon dioxide of course, carbon monoxide CO, nitrogen oxides NOx, soot ie particulate matter, the most harmful being very very small particles less than 2.5 microns in aerodynamic diameter (<10 microns can enter the lungs), and various unburned hydrocarbons and organic radicals such as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde."

"Back in the 90s, another similar figure, the daughter of a prominent environmentalist in Canada (Severn Suzuki) became the figure of en environmental movement as well. For some, Greta is a pawn used under the same banner."

"To be fair, with that headline I almost expected the Daily Mail. Same difference, I guess."

"It’s the difference between reducing and replacing. If we are ramping up renewables and EVs fast enough, we are replacing that system. We are eliminating both production and demand for fossils.

If we reduce production a lot faster than we can replace it - someone else will fill that demand.

Is there any evidence to support the claim that our fossil industry is somehow less evil than any one else’s? My impression was that our shale oil, for example, was significantly worse on every front (enviro damage, processing required, cost) and only was viable for price when artificially restricted supply by OPEC throws prices out of whack.

What is it that could possibly be dirtier in another country? The CO2 emissions from burning is the same regardless of origin, and local oil mining, piping and spill damage won’t hurt us here. I would rather have fossil fuels Not In My Backyard, thanks."

"I believe it's the smell of 'hot electronics' they are calling ozone but are really volatile organic compounds ( in most cases )

"Possibly in the short term. In the long run the more us and other larger and developed countries switch over to renewables and EV's the demand around the world for fossil fuels will go down. It will also have an economy of scale effect and make them more affordable to smaller and or less developed countries. 

Basically if we reduce our production without reducing our demand then yes, it would just re locate environmental issues. Fortunately most everyone also wants to reduce our use (demand) for fossil fuels as well. 

It's a typical fox news article trying to discredit anything that would hurt fossil fuel profits."

"Here are a few websites to look at the impacts different companies are having on things like deforestation and how they support the fossil I dustry. It includes some information about where banks invest their clients money. Worth having a look.

"I see this all the time in environmental groups. 

Person 1: “I’m giving up red meat and reducing other meat/animal consumption by 50%”

Person 2: “Unless you go fully vegan, you suck and may as well not even try”.

Person 1: “I’m giving up single use plastic bags and utensils and only using reusable bags and utensils”

Person 2: “that’s still creating plastic, you should use your hands/carry food in your shirt”

Ok maybe a bit of exaggeration. But if the whole world improved environmental impact by 20% (20% reduced meat, 20% less single use plastic, 20% more sustainable farming practices, 20% more walking/biking vs driving, 20% better at turning lights off when not in use, etc) I struggle to see how that doesn’t have huge benefits across the board.
